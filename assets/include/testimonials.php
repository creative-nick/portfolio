              "Nikhilesh has worked with me on several new business initiatives in which the tasks were to develop new digital products. Armed with in-depth knowledge and experience in UI and UX, he elicited the requirements from different teams in detail and delivered with awesome designs. He has a very good habit of keeping himself up-to-date on new trends in design and development; hence team-members bank on him if they need sound advice. In fact, I have come across very few people who bring a unique blend of diligence and intelligence - Nikhilesh is one of them. The best part - he is always hungry to give value-add in whatever work he does with deep research in his domain so that results may come beyond expectations. He is an asset for the organization in which he works and capable to lead and head team to bring out the best results!"</h5>
